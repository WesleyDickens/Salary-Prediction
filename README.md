# Salary-Prediction

## Regressors Notebook
Overview: This Jupyter notebook is designed to demonstrate the process of building, training, and evaluating XGBoost model and TF-IDF vectorizers. It covers the end-to-end workflow including data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation phases.

Key Components:

Data Loading: Importing datasets and preparing them for use with the XGBoost and TF-IDF models.
Model Definition: Constructing an XGBoost model suitable for the task at hand.
Training Loop: Implementing the training process.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance after splitting training and test data.
Analysis: Offering insights into the training process and model performance with visualizations.

User Inputs for job title and job description: This section of the notebook takes in user inputs for desired job title or job description and outputs the most likely job title associated with each; The purpose is to use the output as the input for the XGBoost model prediction
