# Predicting Salary Brackets w/ XGBoost 

### Purpose: Develop an AI model to forecast salary brackets for job positions
* The algorithm will analyze historical job posting and salary data to predict salary ranges for new job listings. This will provide hiring managers with data-driven salary recommendations.

### Methodology: Train a machine learning model on structured data of job titles, responsibilities, required skills, etc. mapped to corresponding salary brackets.
* The model will identify key factors that correlate with salary levels in order to make accurate predictions.

### Intended impact: Enable data-driven and fair compensation practices. Reduce time spent researching appropriate salary ranges.
* The algorithm's predictions will lead to more standardized salaries based on relevant job factors rather than human bias or guesswork.
